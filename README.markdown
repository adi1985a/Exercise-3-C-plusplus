## üìÑ Overview

The **Rectangle Class Demo**, developed by Adrian Lesniak, is a C++ console application designed to illustrate fundamental object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts through the implementation of a `Prostokat` (Rectangle) class. This class manages properties of a rectangle, including its side lengths (`bokA`, `bokB`), its `kolor` (color as a string), and its calculated `pole` (area). The program showcases the use of default and overloaded constructors for flexible object initialization and a `pokaz()` (show) method to display the rectangle's details. A key aspect is its use of **English variable names and output text**. The `main` function demonstrates creating an array of `Rectangle` objects and displaying their properties.

## ‚ú® Key Features of the `Prostokat` Class

*   üì¶ **Attributes (Private)**:
    *   `sideA`, `sideB`: Integer values representing the lengths of the rectangle's sides.
    *   `color`: A `std::string` storing the color of the rectangle (e.g., "black", "blue", "yellow").
    *   `area`: A `float` storing the calculated surface area of the rectangle.
*   üõ†Ô∏è **Constructors**:
    *   **Default Constructor**: Initializes a rectangle with default values (e.g., sides 0, color black, area 0).
    *   **Overloaded Constructor (Sides and Color)**: Initializes a rectangle with specified side lengths and color. Calculates area internally.
    *   **Overloaded Constructor (Sides Only)**: Initializes a rectangle with specified side lengths and a default color (e.g., yellow). Calculates area internally.
*   üìä **Methods**:
    *   `Show()`: A public method that prints the rectangle's side lengths, color, and calculated area to the console in a formatted way, using english text.
    *   `Calculate Area()` (Calculate Area): A private helper method that computes the area (`sideA * sideB`, cast to `float`) and stores it in the `area` attribute. This is typically called by the constructors.
*   üë®‚Äçüíª **Demonstration in `main()`**:
    *   Creates a fixed-size array (e.g., of four `Rectangle` objects).
    *   Initializes these objects using the various constructors.
    *   Iterates through the array, calling the `show()` method for each `Rectangle` object to display its properties in english.

## üñºÔ∏è Screenshots (Conceptual Output)

The program produces direct console output based on the `show()` method.

**Example Console Output (assuming Polish locale is active and terminal supports it):**
```text
--- ProstokƒÖt #1 ---
D≈Çugo≈õci bok√≥w: 0 x 0
Kolor: czarny
Pole powierzchni: 0.00

--- ProstokƒÖt #2 ---
D≈Çugo≈õci bok√≥w: 5 x 7
Kolor: niebieski
Pole powierzchni: 35.00

--- ProstokƒÖt #3 ---
D≈Çugo≈õci bok√≥w: 3 x 10
Kolor: zielony
Pole powierzchni: 30.00

--- ProstokƒÖt #4 ---
D≈Çugo≈õci bok√≥w: 8 x 8
Kolor: ≈º√≥≈Çty
Pole powierzchni: 64.00
```


## ‚öôÔ∏è System Requirements

*   **Operating System**: Any OS supporting a standard C++ compiler. For correct display of Polish characters, the system's default locale (or one set by the program) must support UTF-8 or a compatible Polish encoding, and the terminal/console application used must also be configured to render these characters correctly.
*   **C++ Compiler**: A C++ compiler (e.g., g++, clang++, MSVC). C++11 or later is good practice.
*   **Standard C++ Libraries**: `<iostream>` (for console I/O), `<string>` (for color attribute), `<locale>` (for `setlocale`).

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation and Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository (if applicable)**:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```
    *(Replace `<repository-url>` and `<repository-directory>` if this code is part of a larger repository).*

2.  **Save Main Code**:
    Ensure your C++ source code (containing the `Prostokat` class definition and implementation, and the `main` function) is saved as `rectangle.cpp` (or your chosen file name, e.g., `prostokat.cpp`) in your project directory.

3.  **Compile the Program**:
    Open a terminal (Command Prompt, PowerShell, Bash, etc.) in the project directory.
    **Example using g++:**
    ```bash
    g++ rectangle.cpp -o rectangle -std=c++11
    ```
    *(Add `-static-libgcc -static-libstdc++` on Windows with MinGW if desired for standalone executables. Ensure your compiler/linker settings handle locales correctly if issues arise).*

4.  **Run the Program**:
    *   On Windows: `.\rectangle.exe` or `rectangle.exe`
    *   On Linux/macOS: `./rectangle` (ensure execute permissions: `chmod +x rectangle`)
    *   *Ensure your terminal is configured to display UTF-8 or the appropriate Polish encoding for correct character rendering.*

## üí° Usage Guide

1.  Compile `rectangle.cpp` as detailed in the "Installation and Setup" section.
2.  Run the compiled executable (`rectangle` or `rectangle.exe`).
3.  **Output**:
    *   The program will directly print the details for each of the four `Prostokat` objects created and initialized in the `main` function. This includes their side lengths ("D≈Çugo≈õci bok√≥w"), color ("Kolor"), and calculated area ("Pole powierzchni"), all in Polish.
4.  **Actions**:
    *   Observe the console output to verify the properties of each rectangle and the correct display of Polish characters.
    *   The program runs a fixed sequence and then terminates. There are no interactive prompts.
    *   To experiment, modify the parameters used when initializing the `Prostokat` objects in the `main` function's array and recompile.

## üóÇÔ∏è File Structure

*   `rectangle.cpp` (or `prostokat.cpp`): The main (and likely only) C++ source file containing the `Prostokat` class definition and implementation, and the `main()` demonstration function.
*   `README.md`: This documentation file.

*(No external data files, log files, or user-provided header files beyond standard libraries are indicated for this specific program as described.)*

## üìù Technical Notes

*   **Encapsulation**: The `Rectangle` class demonstrates encapsulation effectively.
*   **Constructors**: Multiple constructors provide flexibility in object creation.
*   **Area Calculation**: The area (`area`) is calculated as `sideA * sideB` and cast to `float`.
*   **Fixed Demonstration**: The `main` function runs a predefined demonstration without user interaction.

## ü§ù Contributing

Contributions to this **Rectangle Class Demo** are welcome, especially if they aim to:

*   Add more methods to the `Rectangle` class (e.g., `obliczObwod()` for perimeter).
*   Implement user input for creating rectangles dynamically.
*   Provide examples for other locales or improve cross-platform locale handling.
*   Enhance the ASCII art or add more complex shape interactions.
